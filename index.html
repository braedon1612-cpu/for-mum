    <h1>Mum ❤️</h1>

    <p>
        I want to apologise for the way things went today and for the way I spoke to you.
        I should not have responded the way I did. Even if I was frustrated
        I know I could have handled it better.
    </p>

    <p>
        I never meant to disrespect you or make you feel unappreciated.
        I truly see and appreciate everything you and Dad have done for me 
        the sacrifices, the support with school, and always trying to give me the best.
        I don’t take that lightly.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I told you to go find the card, it wasn’t to belittle you.
        I understand that it came across as rude and dismissive
        and for that I’m truly sorry.
    </p>

    <p>
        I love you Mum. I don’t want money or studies to come between us.
        I just want peace between us. I promise to work on my tone
        and how I respond especially when things get heated.
